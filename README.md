PowerShell Universal dashboard displaying Azure DevOps data

## Intro

A dashboard that displays information from my Azure DevOps organisation. Inspired by the Pluralsight course [PowerShell DevOps Playbook].

## Authentication

A Personal Access Token is required to interact with the Azure DevOps API. This can be created by following the [Microsoft documentation].
For the dashboard, 'build read' permission is enough.
